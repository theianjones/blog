Digital garden is a place to store and develop long term thoughts.

My garden is a layer between my raw notes and the essays that I publish. A lot of my notes are [[Progressive Summarization]]s of content that I've payed for. My garden is a way for me to publish my thoughts often.

I would love if [[Roam Research]] was easy to share but I like having my notes under my own umbrella.

## Inspiration

- Andy Matuschak's [notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)
- Joel Hooks' [thoughts digital garden post](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)
- Tom Critchlow's [digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/)

Aegnus McMillin got [`@aengusm/gatsby-theme-brain`](https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain) going and the concept is super dope.

Serious props to Aravind Balla for getting the prototype of notes hover preview as well as the "Referred in" section.
